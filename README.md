## Getting Started

1. This application relies on using Instagram as a third party provider for authentication. As such, you will need to obtain an application key/secret pair from [Instagram](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/)
1. Copy `config/application.example.yml` to `config/application.yml` and replace the `IG_CONSUMER_KEY` and `IG_CONSUMER_SECRET` with the key/secret from step 1.
1. Run `bundle && rake db:migrate && rake` to install the application's dependencies, create the database, and run the tests.
